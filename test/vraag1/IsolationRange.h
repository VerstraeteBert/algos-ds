         * Compares two ranges:
         * if there's an overlap, the number of overlapping elements is returned
         * if there's no overlap, 0 is returned.
         *
         * Determining overlap:
         *  Imagine two ranges
         *  a [----]
         *  b    [---]
         *  The b's minimum must be <= to the a's maximum to have an overlap
         *  Since the ranges could also be compared the other way around,
         *  a    [---]
         *  b [----]
         *  the a's minimum must also be <= to b's maximum
         *  Notice that in both the order, the conditions still must hold true
         *
         *  This logic can be easily inverted (look at the example below)
         *      b.min > a.max ||Â a.min > b.max
         *     a [---]
         *     b         [---]
         *
         *  If there's an overlap we need to figure out the minimum and maximum bound of intersection
         *  a    [---]
         *  b [----]
         *  From the example we can easily see that a's minimum is the minimum bound of the intersection;
         *  conversely b's maxmimum is the maximum bound of the intersection
         *
         *  To generalize this, since the ranges can be in any order
         *  we need to figure out the max(a.min, b.min) and use this as the mimimum bound of the intersection
         *  While min(a.max, b.max) is the maximum bound of the intersection;
         *
         *  e.g.
         *  a [6 10]
         *  b [8 12]
         *
         *  max(a.min, b.min) == 8
         *  min(a.max, b.max) == 10
         *
         *  number of elements in intersection (8, 9, 10)
         *      == (10 - 8) + 1
